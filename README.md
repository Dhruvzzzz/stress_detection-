Student Stress Detection for Quality Education
Project Summary
This project is an innovative web application designed to help educators and students identify and manage stress levels in educational settings. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning, the application provides real-time stress detection through facial expression analysis, offering personalized recommendations for stress management and study techniques.
Key Features
Real-time Stress Detection: Uses webcam to analyze facial expressions and detect stress levels in real-time
Image Upload Analysis: Allows users to upload student photos for stress level assessment
Personalized Recommendations: Provides tailored study techniques and stress management activities based on detected stress levels
Educational Resources: Offers comprehensive resources on stress management and academic performance
Research-Based Approach: Incorporates findings from educational research on stress and learning outcomes
Visual Analytics: Includes 3D visualizations and tracking charts to monitor stress levels over time
Technical Implementation
The application is built using:
Frontend: Streamlit for an interactive web interface
Machine Learning: TensorFlow for facial expression analysis and stress detection
Computer Vision: OpenCV for face detection and image processing
Data Visualization: Plotly and Matplotlib for creating interactive charts and visualizations
Styling: Custom CSS for a modern, responsive design
How It Works
The application captures facial expressions through webcam or uploaded images
A pre-trained deep learning model analyzes facial features to determine stress levels
Based on the detected stress level, the system provides personalized recommendations:
Study techniques appropriate for the current stress level
Stress management activities to help reduce stress
Educational resources relevant to the student's situation
The application tracks stress levels over time, providing insights into stress patterns
Educational Impact
